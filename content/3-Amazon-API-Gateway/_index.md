In this lab, you will create a simple ASP.NET Web API, deploy it with the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) on AWS Lambda, and then configure Amazon API Gateway as a proxy layer in front of the Web API endpoints.

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. By using Amazon API Gateway in front of your application’s API endpoints, you can apply throttling, security, monitoring and logging, and improve performance by using the service’s caching functionality, as well as handle versioning and developer documentation (including Swagger support).

You will complete the following exercises during this lab:

- Create an ASP.NET Web API using AWS Serverless Application template
- Add logging to the Web API
- Deploy ASP.NET Web API to Amazon API Gateway backed by AWS Lambda
- Test Throttling configuration of Amazon API Gateway
